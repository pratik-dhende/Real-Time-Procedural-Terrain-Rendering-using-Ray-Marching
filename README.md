# Real-Time Procedural Terrain Rendering using Ray Marching
This was implemented in a proprietary game engine called Prime Engine.

## Objective
My objective with this project was to explore and understand the following concepts in depth:
- Ray Marching
  - Lighting
  - Shadows
  - Reflections
- Signed Distance Functions
- Procedural Rendering
- Noise functions
- Shader authoring
